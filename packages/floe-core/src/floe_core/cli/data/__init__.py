"""Data team CLI commands (stubs).

This module provides stub CLI commands for Data Team operations:
    floe compile: Validate Data Team floe.yaml (stub)
    floe validate: Validate floe.yaml against platform constraints (stub)
    floe run: Execute pipeline (stub)
    floe test: Run dbt tests (stub)

Note:
    These are stub commands for the Data Team CLI. Full implementation
    is deferred to a future epic. Current implementations print a
    helpful message directing users to Platform Team commands.

Example:
    $ floe compile --help
    $ floe validate --help
